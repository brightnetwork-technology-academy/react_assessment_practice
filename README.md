# Practice Technical Assessment - React

This exercise is designed to give you practice in investigating a new codebase and fixing the problems with it. The app is built in React using class-based components and should display information about historic rocket launches by [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/).

When working properly the app should:

- Display details of the first launch when first launched
- Allow the user to go one launch forwards/back
- Allow the user to skip to the first/last launch
- Allow the user to enter a specific launch to view
- Only display a launch if a valid launch number is provided
- Open a link to the Wikipedia page in a new tab when the link is clicked

There are **ten** bugs in the code - some are more obvious than others.

Remember to use the React Developer Tools ([chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en), [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)) and carefully read the error messages to help with your debugging.
